# 30 Days of Ramadan ðŸŒ™

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures problems and their solutions for the 30 days of Ramadan challenge. Each day, a new problem will be added to the repository along with its solution.

## How to Use

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/30days-of-ramadan.git</pre>



Each day's problem will be located in its own folder within the problems directory. Within each folder, you will find a README.md file describing the problem and a solution.js file containing the solution. Feel free to explore the code and try to come up with your own solutions!


## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the repository by adding a new problem and solution, please follow these steps:

Fork the repository to your own GitHub account
Create a new branch for your changes
Add your problem and solution to a new folder within the problems directory
Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch
Please make sure to provide clear documentation and comments within your code, and ensure that your solution is correct and efficient.




We hope this repository helps you improve your problem-solving skills and strengthens your knowledge of algorithms and data structures. Happy coding!
